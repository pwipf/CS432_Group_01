Elastic Pathing: Your Speed is Enough to Track You

Insurance companies want lots of information on drivers. Tracking devices in modern cars are common, but privacy concerns with full location tracking are real. A compromise for the insurance company is to keep track of vehicle speed and not location. This speed data set can be revealing for the insurance company, as a low-risk driver probably has a quite different “speed profile” than a high-risk driver.
The paper addresses the problem of:  Given lots of speed data and a home address (and a road map), there is a possibility of extracting the location data anyway.  So the privacy concerns are not necessarily reduced by only tracking speed data.


So the actual algorithm studied is Elastic Pathing which addresses the problem:
Given a data trace with speed/time tuples, recreate a driving path.
